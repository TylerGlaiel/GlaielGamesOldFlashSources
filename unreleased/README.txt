This is a collection of unfinished and not-officially-released flash games that I figured would be interesting to show here. 

"catvsmouse", "RPG", and "dorgamir" are the 3 most interesting games here.

"Catvsmouse" was a big rube goldberg machine building puzzle game I made when I was 14 but never completely finished. I think this might have been the last game I worked on before discovering Newgrounds

"RPG" was an attempt at making a big RPG game when I was 14. I had no idea what arrays were when I made this. It probably had like 2 hours of gameplay in it by the time I stopped working on it. 

"Dorgamir" was a boss rush game I was working on when I was 18 where you would fight one huge multi-phase boss fight against a dragon where each phase was a different style of game.
