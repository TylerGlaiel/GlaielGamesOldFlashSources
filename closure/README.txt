Closure is the flash game that led to us making a big expanded version as my first commercial version. The flash version used a lot of weird interesting flash tech, its definitely worth checking it out. I don't currently plan on open sourcing the full version of the game, as that was not made in flash and is still for sale on Steam. 

Closure is notable for using adobe's short-lived "Pixel Bender" tool (basically adobe's first attempt at letting flash use shaders). It was one of the few games to ever use that feature.

Closure.fla is too large for the repository and is included in "Releases" instead.
