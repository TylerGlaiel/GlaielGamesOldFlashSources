Magnetism and Magnetism 2 were the first games I made that went viral & actually earned me money. 

I used a programmed called "Swift3D" for the graphics in these games (and most of my other early flash games as well). It was a basic 3D modeler that would export vector animations that could be used in flash games. As ugly as that stuff is in retrospect, it did make those games "look impressive" compared to the other cartoonier flash games of the time, and that may have played a role in why they went viral.

Magnetism was so popular when it came out I remember watching someone in my high school play the game during class without realizing I made it. Was absolutely surreal.
