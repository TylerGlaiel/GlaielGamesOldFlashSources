Blockslide was the first game I made *after* discovering newgrounds. Blockslide 2 was an ambitious attempt at a sequel that took way too long to make and didn't end up turning out too good. I learned a ton about game design from it's game design failures though. 

blockslide.fla and blockslide2.fla are both too large for the repository and are included in the releases zip instead
