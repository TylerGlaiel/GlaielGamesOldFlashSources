Blockslide was the first game I made *after* discovering newgrounds. Blockslide 2 was an ambitious attempt at a sequel that took way too long to make and didn't end up turning out too good. I learned a ton about game design from it's game design failures though. 

blockslide.fla is too large for the repository and are included in "Releases" instead
(blockslide2.fla is pending permission from a collaborator)
