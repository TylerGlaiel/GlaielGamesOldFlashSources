# GlaielGamesOldFlashSources
a release of the source code for all my old flash games, for educational &amp; preservation purposes only

All games in this repository are licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)
This means you can use these for non-commercial uses only, with attribution, and must release any derivitave versions you create under the same license. Basically, use these for preservation and educational purposes only.

If games I made are currently missing from this dump, it's because I either lost the flas, couldn't reach collaborators for permission to open source, didn't receive permission to open source, or the games are currently available in commercial format (Aether and AVGM are excluded because they are both currently available as part of (The Basement Collection)[https://store.steampowered.com/app/214790/The_Basement_Collection/] on steam)

If I locate any lost sources or get permission from collaborators I will add in some of the missing games.


Blockslide, Closure, Nutcracker, Pigeon Pooper 2, and Spectrum's FLA files are all too large to be included in a github repo. Check Releases to download those files (they still probably need to be placed in their repsective folders)

I have resaved none of these files under newer versions of flash. They remain as they were when I last published versions of them for the internet. Please only file issues if it's apparant that I forgot a file necessary to export the game, I will not fix any issues within the games or fla files themselves. I have included no fonts with any of these games (I don't have them either), just google for the fonts flash says it's missing.
